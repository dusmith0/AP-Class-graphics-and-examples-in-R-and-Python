## Python_Class_Graphics
# Description
This contains some small Python scripts that I have used for demonstrations in Class. These use the libraries math, matplotlib, and numpy.

# Uses
Many of the above scripts are intended to be edited during class. For instance, the file Sigma.py will allow the user to input data and the script will return the variance and standard deviation of the data. These are not intended as full functions, and instead as templete files for building very simple graphics.
